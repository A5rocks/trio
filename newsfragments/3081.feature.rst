Added :func:`trio.lowlevel.add_parking_lot_breaker` and :func:`trio.lowlevel.remove_parking_lot_breaker` to allow creating custom lock/semaphore implementations that will break their underlying parking lot if a task exits unexpectedly. :meth:`trio.lowlevel.ParkingLot.break_lot` is also added, to allow breaking a parking lot intentionally.
