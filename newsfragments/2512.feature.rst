:func:`trio.move_on_after` and :func:`trio.fail_after` now allows setting the deadline to be relative to entering the context manager. This will be the default in the future, and to opt into the new behaviour you can pass ``timeout_from_enter=True``.  This does not matter in the vast majority of cases where initialization and entering of the context manager is in the same place, and those cases will not raise any :class:`DeprecationWarning`. For more information see :ref:`saved_relative_timeouts`.
