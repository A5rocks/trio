:func:`trio.move_on_after` and :func:`trio.fail_after` previously set the deadline relative to initialization time, instead of more intuitively upon entering the context manager. Any code where these two points in time do not line up (according to :func:`trio.current_time`) will now issue a `DeprecationWarning`. To silence the warning and adopt the new behaviour, pass ``timeout_from_enter = True``. For more information see :ref:`saved_relative_timeouts`.
