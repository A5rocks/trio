The :ref:`strict_exception_groups <strict_exception_groups>` parameter now defaults to `True` in `trio.run` and `trio.lowlevel.start_guest_run`. `trio.open_nursery` still defaults to the same value as was specified in `trio.run`/`trio.lowlevel.start_guest_run`, but if you didn't specify it there then all subsequent calls to `trio.open_nursery` will change.
This is unfortunately very tricky to change with a deprecation period, as raising a `DeprecationWarning` whenever :ref:`strict_exception_groups <strict_exception_groups>` is not specified would raise a lot of unnecessary warnings.
