``strict_exception_groups`` now defaults to True in ``trio.run`` and ``trio.start_guest_run``, as well as ``trio.open_nursery`` as a result of that.
This is unfortunately very tricky to change with a deprecation period, as raising a ``DeprecationWarning`` whenever ``strict_exception_groups`` is not specified would raise a lot of unnecessary warnings.
