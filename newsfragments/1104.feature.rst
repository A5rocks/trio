You can now conveniently spawn a child process in a background task
and interact it with on the fly using ``process = await
nursery.start(run_process, ...)``. See `run_process` for more details.
We recommend most users switch to this new API. Also note that:

- ``trio.open_process`` has been deprecated in favor of
  `trio.lowlevel.open_process`,
- The ``aclose`` method on `Process` has been deprecated along with
  ``async with process_obj``.
