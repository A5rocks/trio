The typing of :func:`trio.abc.HostnameResolver.getaddrinfo` has been corrected to
match that of the stdlib `socket.getaddrinfo`, which was updated in mypy 1.15 (via
a typeshed update) to include the possibility of ``tuple[int, bytes]`` for the
``sockaddr`` field of the result. This happens in situations where Python was compiled
with ``--disable-ipv6``.
