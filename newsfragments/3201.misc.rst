The typing of :func:`trio.abc.HostnameResolver.getaddrinfo` has been corrected to
match that of the stdlib `socket.getaddrinfo`, which was updated in mypy 1.15 (via
a typeshed update) to include the possibility of ``tuple[int, bytes]`` for the
``sockaddr`` field of the result. This happens in situations where Python was compiled
with ``--disable-ipv6``.

Additionally, when using mypy 1.15, the static typing of
:func:`trio.to_thread.run_sync`, :func:`trio.from_thread.run` and
:func:`trio.from_thread.run_sync` has been improved and should reflect the underlying
function being run.
